# AdaMatch-TF
Includes additional materials for the following keras.io blog post: [Semi-supervision and domain adaptation with AdaMatch](https://keras.io/examples/vision/adamatch/).

## About the notebooks

* `AdaMatch.ipynb`: Original notebook submitted for the [PR](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-io/pull/513).
* `Vanilla_WideResNet.ipynb`: Trains a WideResNet-28-2 on MNIST (source domain) and evaluates on the SVHN dataset (target domain). The model trained in this notebook serves as the baseline. 

## Acknowledgements

* Fran√ßois Chollet for helping with the implementation.
* [ML-GDE](https://developers.google.com/programs/experts/) program for providing GCP credits that supported the experiments.
